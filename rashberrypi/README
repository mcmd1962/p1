General setup
=============
. On the rashberry pi:
  + the P1 reader script is running which produces local data files in csv format and a log file by supervisor
  + the local user crontab entry is started at the boot of the server to transfer these csv files to a remote server which is storing the data in a postgres database and is running a web server to display the data.

. On the remote server
  + A Postgres database is running to store in all the data in aggregated format.
  + A apache webserver is running to display the data. A few simple reports are available.


P1 reader script
================
The P1 reader script is run by supervisor, the relevant config file for this is in etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. This file must be edited to set the correct command and user.

The P1reader script is located in home/user/bin/ and is called P1reader.py. This script is reading a P1 datagram which in my case looks something like:
     /ISk52MT382-1003
     1-0:1.8.1(00438.023*kWh)
     1-0:1.8.2(00384.391*kWh)
     1-0:2.8.1(00000.000*kWh)
     1-0:2.8.2(00000.001*kWh)
     0-0:96.14.0(0002)
     1-0:1.7.0(0000.62*kW)
     1-0:2.7.0(0000.00*kW)
     0-0:17.0.0(0999.00*kW)
     0-0:96.3.10(1)
     0-0:96.13.1()
     0-0:96.13.0()
     !
This script assumes that directory /home/user/data exists. This script assumes that the rashberry pi is running nginx and will create a simple web page with the last 10 measurements. It first checks whether the webserver is being used by checking the update time on file /var/log/nginx/access.log (line 337) before it writes this html file. The writing of the html file is done in print_html function. Code for this can be found at lines 45, 98-123, 337-345. Modify or deactivate where needed.


Transfer files
==============
The P1 reader script is producing local files with data in csv format. These files
Files are transferred to the remote server using scp. The script name is TransferFiles.sh.
The script is started from cron, see file home/user/cron/user.cron

usr/share/nginx/html/p1
=======================
The P1 reader script is trying to write a file in this directory with the last 10 measurements.
